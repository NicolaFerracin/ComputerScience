## EVA - Extravehicular Activities

Austronauts suits came from the development of high-altitude aviation pressure suits.

To survive in space, you need:

- Oxygen (2 tanks in the backpack, lasting for around 8hrs)
- COâ‚‚ removal
- Pressure (in case the suits is compromised) - in these cases the secondary oxygen tank enters into play to regulate pressure due to the leak. For a leak of 6mm, the secondary oxygen tank should keep pressure in balance for ~30 minutes
- Thermal Control
- Food and drink
- Communication System
- Power

### Thermal Control

Under direct sunlight, materials can get up to 120 degrees.

- Spacesuits are equipped with a sublimator (evaporates water in space -> sublimate).
- LCVG: liquid cooling and ventilation garment: a garment with tubes where cold water runs through, in contact with the skin, cooling it off

At night, temperatures can get down to -155 degrees.

- below the LCVG you have a kind of leggings made of fireproof material
- electrically heated glove fingers

## Flexibility - Pressure

Being pressurized, the suit works like a baloon: it stiffens you and doesn't allow a lot of flexibility.

**To increase flexibility you can decrease pressure by increasing the oxygen density.**

When going between different pressures too quickly you may suffer decompression sickness (because you go from an environment of mixed-gases to one of almost pure oxygen). Decompression sickness can cause bubbles to get into the joints, or cause skin rashes or have negative impact on your central nerval system.

One way to prevent this is to prebreathe pure oxygen before going into a lower-pressure environment, to wash out nitrogen from your body.

## Flexibility - Volume

To ensure flexibility, we can also operate on the volume. When folding a baloon, the stifenning happens because the volume decreases and the pressure increases. By ensuring the volume doesn't decrease when flexing, we allow more flexibility.

Spacesuits are equipped with convolute joints: when they bend there is as little volume change as possible.

## Space Robotics

2 types of robots at the moment:
- Free-flying, free-floating systems: Orbital Robots for construction and servicing of satellites and stations
- Exploration robots for discovering
