* Humans and automation


CDIO: Conceive - Design - Implement - Operate

## The Aerospace Perspective

* Aeronautics is the air part of aerospace
* Pression at sea level = 1kg / cm2. Going at higher altitude the pressure decreseases exponentially. At 5.5km we are at 1/2 of pressure. At 8km it's 1/3.
* Low pressure is better for planes: less drag -> less fuel consumption. The highest commercial airplane flies at 12km (80% to the top of the lowest of the earth's atmosphere - Troposphere. Where almost all weather fenomena occur)
* Troposphere (12km a.s.l.) - Stratosphere (50km a.s.l.) - Mesosphere (80km asl) - Thermosphere (320km asl) - Exosphere (1000km asl)
* Stratosphere: 90% of the ozone is here in the ozone layer (between 20/30km asl). Some planes can fly here, or research baloons (heliums) with a diameter of up to 160m and go up to 45km
* Exosphere: where all human space activities take places
* *Where do space begins?*: 100km, at the Von K치rm치n line
* At the Von K치rm치n is still to close for rockets to orbit, the lowest is a little over 200km
* Geostationary orbit is 36.000km away. At this distance the orbital period is 24hrs as for the earth so they hover on always the same point on earth (nice for telecommunications)
* The moon is ~400.000km away - earth circumference is ~40.000km. Distance from the moon is 10x earth circumference. 3 days for the Apollo austronauts to cover it
* Talking about Mars as the next objective: at the closest point it is 40.000.000km away (100x then the moon)
* It takes around 10min for radio signal to travel to Mars. Rover robot had to go extremely slow to allow for the delay. It covered 200m in 264 Mars days (25hrs days)
