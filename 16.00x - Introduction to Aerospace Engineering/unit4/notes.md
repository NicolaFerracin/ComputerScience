## Circular Orbits

- simple orbital motion: an object going around a second object. The motion is elliptic
- the force between two objects is inversed square: if you move the 2 objects at twice the distant, the gravitational force drops to a quarter
- in the formula we use the **Netwon's gravitational constant** which we believe is constant throughout the whole universe
- *the velocity at which the second object moves around the orbit does **not** depend on the second object mass, it only depends on the first object mass*
- the above deduction means that any object at a given distant moves at the same velocity. This is particularly important with the ISS: we can send ships that are much smaller than the station and they will move at the same velocity, given they are at the same distance from earth
- as the second object gets farther away from the first object, its orbital velocity decreases
- the distance at which the rotation period equals 24hrs is **42.240km**. This is particularly important for satelitte as they need to be moving over the same point on earth all the time
- the orbit on which the period is 24hrs, is called the **Geostationary Orbit**
