## Microgravity

For a complete abscence of gravity you would have to be infinitely away from any body. In space you actually experience **microgravity**.

The concept of weight comes from both the gravity pushing us down but also from the earth pushing us up, as per Newton's 3rd law (action/reaction). So you need both forces to experience weight. In orbit you still there is still gravity, but in the abscence of the ground pushing back, you experience weightlessness.

On the ISS you can conduct various long-running experiments in microgravity, but even the crew moving, the solar panels redirection and other mechanical movements cause g-jitters, changes in the gravity force, which can cause disturbances to the experiments.

## The heart and circulatory system

### Fluid shifts

When on earth, gravity applies a force to bring fluids to the lower body. When you get into space, gravity is not applied anymore, so you get much more fluids to the upper body, often causing headaches for the first few days. The body receptors identify an excess of fluids that get expelled via urination and lack of thirst. When going back to earth, the body now goes back to "normal" but with less fluids, preventing normal functioning (can't stay straight, fainting...).

## Muscles

In space there is no weight -> muscles atrophy -> astronauts need 3 hours of excercise per day

## Skeleton

Bones are not static, they actually grow and shrink. In space, since they are not put under any stress, the body believes the bones have too much calcium and start losing some, making the bones shrink and grow weaker.

In space you experience a loss of around 1 to 3% of bone per month. It hasn't been proven that the loss stops at some point so there is reason to believe that the aastronauts might be experiencing bone loss for as long as they stay in space.

Considering a trip to Mars (3 years) a fit 45-yo astronaut would reach Mars with the bones of an 80-yo person.
