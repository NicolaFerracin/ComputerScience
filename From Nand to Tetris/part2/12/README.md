Last assignment of the Nand2Tetris part 2 course, where we write the whole OS, including:

- Math class
- Array class

- Keyboard class
- String class
- Sys class

Previous assignments consisted in:

- writing a VM Translator in modules [07](../07) and [08](../08)

- writing a compiler from Jack to Hack assembly-like language in modules [10](../10) and [11](../11)

## Tests

Each single class has its own set of tests in the respective folder. Include the class in the test folder, compile the folder and run the tests using the VMEmulator.

After writing all classes, the OS can be tested as a whole by including all classes in the [Pong](./Pong) folder, compiling them and running them via the provided VMEmulator.
