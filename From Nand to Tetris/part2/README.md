# Course Overview

Offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2/home/welcome).

From Nand To Tetris is a two-part course aimed at building a computer, starting from a NAND logic gate, up to using a Java-like high-level language called Jack to write programs that run on our own system.

- [Part 1](../part1) is dedicated to building all the logic gates, all the chips and the assembler
- Part 2 is first focused on writing a two-tier compiler that goes from the high-level language (Jack) to VM code and then from VM code to assembly code (Hack). It also features writing the whole operating system in Jack

# Modules

NOTE: the numbering is a continuation of part1 of the course. Module 4 was also part of part1 and it's reproposed in part2 for revisiting key-concepts.

- [Module 4](./04): revisit key-concepts from part1
- [Module 7](./07): start writing the first part of the two-tier compiler (namely the part that translates VM code into assembly code)
- [Module 8](./08): finish writing the first part of the two-tier compiler
- [Module 9](./09): use the high-level Jack language to write a program of your choice (I decided to write a snake-like game)
- [Module 10](./10): start writing the second part of the two-tier compiler (namely the part that translates Jack code into VM code)
- [Module 11](./11): finish writing the second part of the two-tier compiler
- [Module 12](./12): write the OS
