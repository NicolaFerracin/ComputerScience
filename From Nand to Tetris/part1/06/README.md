# Project Week 6
## Build an assembler

### Objective
Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.

### The Assembler
The assembler has been built using Javascript in one single file, index.html. It can be opened in any browser without the need of being connected to internet.

The other files are binary files obtained using the assembler and compared to the given ones offered by the Nand2Tetris staff.
