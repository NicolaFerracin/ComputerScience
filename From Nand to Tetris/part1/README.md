# Course Overview

Offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris1/home/welcome).

From Nand To Tetris is a two-part course aimed at building a computer, starting from a NAND logic gate, up to using a Java-like high-level language called Jack to write programs that run on our own system.

- Part 1 is dedicated to building all the logic gates, all the chips and the assembler
- [Part 2](../part2) is first focused on writing a two-tier compiler that goes from the high-level language (Jack) to VM code and then from VM code to assembly code (Hack). It also features writing the whole operating system in Jack

# Modules

- [Module 1](./01): logic gates chips
- [Module 2](./02): adders chips
- [Module 3](./03): RAM chips
- [Module 4](./04): write modules in assembly
- [Module 5](./05): assemble the chips from modules 1, 2 and 3 to build a 16-bit computer, _Hack_
- [Module 6](./06): write the assembler, used to turn assembly code into binary instructions
