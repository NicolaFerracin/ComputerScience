The Internet of Things
Week 4

-------------------------------

ROI in the IoT
1. Real-Time instrumentation
2. generates big data insights. Value in cross-correlating data
Differences in B2B and B2C markets

-------------------------------

B2B:
- long sales cycles (from first contact to final deal)
- challenge of breaking silos
- capitalise on the opportunity of big data
- "the one bridge": only a relative small amount of customers. If you fail, you fail big (because of the word-of-mouth
and the rather closed market). Better to focus on one customer

-------------------------------

B2C:
- cash-flow: marketing mainly, to alert the population of your product
- customer support
- customer worries/customer illiteracy in matter of IoT

-------------------------------

Milestones in creating an IoT focused company:
1. Start
2. Pass the point of no return
3. Move from prototype to product
4. Become a market-driven company (from being a technology-driven company)
