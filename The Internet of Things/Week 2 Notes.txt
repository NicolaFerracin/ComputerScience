The Internet of Things
Week 2

-------------------------------

Connectivity:
how to connect all these things in the IoT
Need: wireless connectivity solution withouth battery supplies issues.

First solution: Zigbee
Problem: it work only in a short range. Not useful for reliable and high-scale IoT projects. It loses data and requires babysitting.
Mistakes:
1. believe the pitch on the need for low-power high-energy technologies. This is wrong because what we need is a high-power low-energy
 solution: energy drains the battery, power gives range. -> Transfer big chunks of data in a short time, then sleep for most of the time
2. regulations/legal problems
3. cost: focused on chip cheaps, while the big cost ended up to be personnel cost (field engineers for trouble-shooting)

-------------------------------

WiFi is a great candidate to share connectivity. BUT fairly large energy consumption. 
This has changed when DUTY CYCLING: put the sensor to sleep when nothing is happening -> 10x more efficient then Zigbee
IEEE is working on a new standard for the low power WiFi version -> 802.11ah
Configuration:
. 6000 sensors attached to a single access point communitcating at around 100kbps
. Sub-GHz ISM bands
. Default WiFi transmission power of 200mW
. Range of 1km

-------------------------------

Existing tech: low power wide area network 
PROS:
1. coverage
	. suburban-rural range 20km
	. urban range 5km
	. difficult urban range 1-2km
2. cost
	. chip is cheap
	. subscription fees is low
	. 1$ per chip and 1$ per year per subscription
3. availability
	. works NOW!
	. success with large projects (Moscow Smart City: 20000 sensors connected to a very few access points)
