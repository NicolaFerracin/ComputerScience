Big Data Analytics
 -> give life to data collected through the sensors
Using alghoritms we can extract the:
- known knowns: e.g. linear regression
- known unknowns: e.g. machine learning
- unknown unknowns: Deep lerning algorithms

Example: Have a store with sensors under each product.
Known knowns: plot a chart with number of items on the x and time on the y. You can see the rate and how quickly the shelves are being emptied
Known unknowns: machine learning will establish which product is taken off and at what rate and would then help enabling a better supply chain decision
Unknown unknowns: would help understanding why some products are selling and why others aren't
